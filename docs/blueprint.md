# **App Name**: ServiceFlow

## Core Features:

- Barcode Scanner Integration: Integrate a barcode scanner for quick data entry and device identification.
- Service Request Form: Implement a dynamic form that appears upon scanning a new barcode, allowing selection of 'Charging', 'Maintenance', or 'Software' services and capturing relevant device details.
- Device Lookup: Enable the system to retrieve and display device details when a scanned barcode matches an existing record.
- Service Dashboard: Design a dashboard with tabs for 'Charging', 'Maintenance', and 'Software' services, each displaying a list of devices and a counter indicating the number of devices in each category.
- Archiving System: Implement an archiving system to move device records from the active list to an archive upon handover, allowing barcode reuse and maintaining historical data. Data is stored locally.
- Reporting Module: Generate statistics on shop performance, providing insights into the number of devices serviced in each category (charging, maintenance, software) over selected time periods.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep blue (#3F51B5) to evoke trust and reliability in managing services.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F2F5), providing a clean and modern backdrop for the interface.
- Accent color: A vibrant purple (#9C27B0) for interactive elements and call-to-action buttons.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' for a modern and neutral feel, ensuring readability across the platform.
- Use a set of minimalist icons to represent each service type and action, improving usability and visual appeal.
- The layout is structured with clear divisions for input, live devices, archive, and reports, each easily accessible for quick navigation.
- Subtle transitions and feedback animations for interactions, such as scanning a barcode or saving data, to provide a smooth user experience.
